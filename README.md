## Usage Instructions
### 1. Install / clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/successor-ai/plume-season-2.git
cd plume-season-2
```
### 2. (Optional but recommended) Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
Then activate the virtual environment:
#### Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
#### macOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
### 3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 4. Prepare `private_key.txt`:
Store your Ethereum private keys here:
```text
0x8j64fda56d6778xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
0x8j64fda56d6778xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### 5. Configure `.env` with your preferences:
```yaml
WRAP_TO_Wplume=false
UNWRAP_TO_plumee=false
SWAP_TO_PUSD=false
SWAP_PUSD_TO_Wplume=false
ENABLE_STAKING=false

AMOUNT_TO_WRAP_plume=[0.05, 0.15]
AMOUNT_TO_UNWRAP_Wplume=[0.01, 0.05]
AMOUNT_TO_SWAP_Wplumee_PUSD=[0.005, 0.01]
AMOUNT_TO_SWAP_PUSD_Wplume=[0.01, 0.05]
AMOUNT_TO_STAKE_plumee=1

MIN_PUSD_EXPECTED=0.000001
MIN_Wplume_EXPECTED=0.0000000001

STAKE_VALIDATOR_ID=3
NUM_REPETITIONS=1
SLIPPAGE_TOLERANCE=0.01

MIN_START_DELAY=5
MAX_START_DELAY=15
DELAY_BETWEEN_INTERACTIONS_SEC=[5, 10]
TX_TIMEOUT=300
MAX_RETRIES=3
RETRY_DELAY_SEC=5
WAIT_TIME_FOR_LOOP=100
MAX_WORKERS=4
```
#### Note: You can adjust these values to tailor the b0t behavior.

### 6. Run the b0t:
```bash
python main.py
```
The b0t will initiate each account's trading cycle with randomized start delays and operate in continuous looping cycles based on your configuration.

### Graceful Shutdown
The b0t supports safe interruption (Ctrl+C), terminating all threads/processes cleanly while preserving state if applicable.
